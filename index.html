<p>Costa Rica is a small country, with a population of around five million people. San José, the capital city, is the most populated city (with around 1.5 million habitants), and most of the big artistic events are centralized in the Metropolitan Area. Costa Rica is divided into seven provinces, and the provinces are divided into a total of 84 cantons. However, only 22 of those cantons have at least one movie theater, according to the data provided by the Chamber of Distributors and Exhibitors (CADEC) and Costa Rican Film Production Center.</p>

<p>San José, located at the heart of Costa Rica, is the canton with most movie theaters, including commercial cinemas as well as special niche spots like Sala Garbo and Sala Gómez Miralles. In contrast, Limón is a province with a population of almost 400.000 people, but there is only one movie theater in this whole area.</p>

<p>“Most of the cinemas are located within a mall or a commercial area,” explains Mandy Tristán, Costa Rican producer. “People don’t just go to the movies. It’s a whole commercial experience that includes shopping and visiting the mall.”</p>

<p>Mandy also worked for four years in the Costa Rica International Film Festival (CRFIC), an event that brings independent movies from all over the world, showcasing national and regional films. Since 2019, one of its priorities is bringing “territorial justice” to those communities that don’t have access to this kind of entertainment. This includes an itinerant phase, in which the festival travels around the country with equipment to project films, and visits communities with no movie theaters.</p>

<p>As the Audience Management Coordinator, Tristán worked closely with those communities. “People are in need of cultural experience. This is how we connect with different stories and different cultures,” she states. “Some of them had never seen a movie on a big screen before. Once we visited a community, people wanted to repeat the experience.”</p>
